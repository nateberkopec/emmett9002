where when and why did i develop this shameless love of kawaii desu
This is the first weekly Burzum friday
it's funny to imagine that people might have favorited/RTed that Steel Angel Kurumi tweet because they thought it was a joke...
today i have a compulsion to type a lot so i will both write much code and tweet much twet i think
that pretty much sums it up RT @emmett9002: "SECURITY/C/ASSEMBLY/TCP/IP WOW,"
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna listen to Burzum at work
my twitter just got harder to look at 
should i listen to burzum at work
keweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

I just spent about 8 hours making a game based on a @petermolydeux tweet with @radstronomical and I really like it
I'm at Cafe Pick Me Up (New York, NY) 
Super funny that me and @radstronomical are legitimately into what might be the crappiest tennis video game, Break Point Tennis
I bought a Good Charlotte album in middle school and then realized that it was shameful to own it so I cut it with scissors
that said....it is still pretty bad. IMO Good Charlotte is one of the few bands that I was justified in hating in middle school
that's why i'm listening to it on Spotify
Listening to Good Charlotte and idgaf who knows it
I love presidents
thanks Team Teamwork, now it's impossible for me to play Ocarina of Time without rapping

About to check out an apartment in sooooohoooooo
Step 1:  Step 2:  Step 3: WIN
getting closer and closer to just designing it myself b/c you're not very helpful, twitter
that's what doctors say but then it's like "50 ccs of something STAT" not business cards
Very Serious: would anyone out there in the Twitter like to take a commission from me to design a business card? I need a business card STAT
that sounds like a pretty dumb thing to get angry about though, huh
oh right it was being reminded that people other are more experienced than me and have had insanely unbelievably cool jobs
i forget what it was exactly but somewhere between apartment shopping and finding a mouse in my room I am now in a foul mood
hey mouse GTFO of my room
also really looking forward to finding lots of mouse poop everywhere when i move out
at least my bed's high off the floor so there's not much chance of him going there although HEY WHO KNOWS RIGHT AHAHA THIS IS GREAT
Can't wait to move out of the basement
oh COOL there's a mouse/possibly rat in my room! RAD

Let it be known that in general, I think it sucks when people are flaky.
Fun fact: the parsely extract API relies on several other technologies including celery and rabbit
Added to my list of priorities: learn OpenGL
I rarely say that

it feels like a problem. Just really...."CALL OF DUTY"!?
I'm generally opposed to the philosophy that games teach violence, but in a modern military context, and with such a popular game...
Think about how crazy this is - we're explicitly being called to military duty by our video games.
