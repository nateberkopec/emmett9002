Someone please recommend a book on OpenGL to me. In return, 
If software is made for users, is a bug only a bug if someone notices it?

this has been a very brief history of the music video with me emmett ok i'm gonna do something else now
 and this one to round it out
this is actually an amazing song and video

obligatory, since i'm posting old music videos  also note the irony in the fact that you're watching this on youtube
 not grey
"DIG YOURSELF" 
when was the last time you listened to just one track off of Sgt. Pepper? reminded yourself that it's a studio masterpiece?
i really want to blog about this instead of tweeting, but that would require, like....forming full sentences and cohesive thoughts.....meh
the influence of this  can definitely be seen here

This is incredible @NeedADebitCard

If you don't know about Ebichu, now you do. 
The first time I played RE4 i probably spent an hour on the room in the castle with the rectangular pools. So much fun.
that's what I mean by action strategy: games that put you in positions like that so you have to be very deliberate about how you fight
When I have to spend half an hour and fifteen attempts to get past a room full of zombies on limited ammo and 10% health, i'm p happy.
I think that despite not being scary, Dead Space 2 does a really good job with action strategy situations. Probably as good a job as RE4
i would never use someone just for their copy of dead space 2, that would be awful of me

An open letter to Diplo: stop telling the “ladies” to dance, line up against the wall, etc.
Oh good thing he’s remixing Levels now. It’s been way too long since I heard that one.
I’ve never experienced this much privileged bass in my life. Drop the privilege.
